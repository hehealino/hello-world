Hello World.

My name is Hehea Lino. I have a BSc in Computer Science and Information Systems
but have only recently started to realise that I need to put that knowledge
to good use because what's the use of learning for 4 to 6 years if you don't build something
with it. So here I am, using GitHub to keep track of the future potential
projects that I want to work on.

So yeah...
